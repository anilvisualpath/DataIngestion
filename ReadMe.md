##Data Ingestion 

This project aims to fetch the data from different Stock Markets across the world and store the data in NoSql database like Cassandra and Hbase.

Initially we are working with Cassandra and later we will work with HBase so that we can also perform some bench making on it.

We are planning to implement the project in all the famous Cassandra clients available. The following Clients are considered 

* Hector 		  -	Nagarjuna
* Astyanax	  -	Narasimha
* Kundera		  -	Open, let us know if anyone is interested to work on it
* Pelops		  -	Open, let us know if anyone is interested to work on it
